                Cricket has been a big part of my childhood. I spent countless hours playing the game with friends, and it remains the sport I've engaged with the most. In my younger days, I not only played cricket regularly but also followed it closely on television.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Although I don't get much time to play nowadays, I still enjoy watching cricketâ€”especially when the Indian national team is playing. Whether itâ€™s a Test match, a T20, or a One Day International, I try my best to follow the games. During major international tournaments like the World Cup or Champions Trophy, watching matches becomes almost unavoidable for me! And when I canâ€™t stream the games live, I make sure to keep checking the scores.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Iâ€™m a huge fan of <strong>Virat Kohli</strong> and <strong>Rohit Sharma</strong>â€”two of Indiaâ€™s finest batters. Their dedication, skill, and leadership continue to inspire cricket fans like me.

              I began learning swimming during my bachelorâ€™s and continued it during my masterâ€™s. Iâ€™ve always been drawn to water â€” thereâ€™s something calming about being near it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Swimming, to me, is more than just a sport. Itâ€™s a full-body workout that especially improves breathing through better inhalation and exhalation. It also helps maintain weight and build endurance. Thatâ€™s why I truly believe swimming is one of the best forms of exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although I never competed professionally, Iâ€™ve always enjoyed swimming as a personal sport.
            </p>
            <p>
              The video you see on the left was taken at one of the swimming pools at the University of California, San Diego. I absolutely loved the facilities and the overall experience there.

            <p>
              Iâ€™m from <strong>Maharashtra</strong>, a culturally rich state in India, and Iâ€™ve always loved cooking and eating <strong>Maharashtrian food</strong>. More specifically, I belong to the <strong>Khandesh region</strong> in northern Maharashtra, which has its own distinct food culture. I enjoy preparing and eating traditional <em>Khandeshi dishes</em>, many of which are known for their bold flavors and generous use of spices. <strong>Mutton curry</strong> is especially popular in Khandesh, and I never miss the chance to enjoy them whenever I visit home.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interestingly, my favorite dish isn't from Maharashtra â€” it's <strong>Biryani</strong>! While not as popular in my home state, I absolutely love the rich aroma and layered spices of this iconic Indian dish.
            </p>
            <p>
              My love for food goes well beyond regional boundaries. Iâ€™m a big fan of <strong>Indian cuisine</strong> in general, but when it comes to international food, <strong>Mexican cuisine</strong> is a close second. I especially enjoy <em>tacos</em> and <em>burritos</em> â€” but only when they come with a good serving of <strong>salsa</strong>; the dish just feels incomplete without it!
            </p>
            <p>
              I also enjoy <strong>Thai food</strong>, and my go-to order at Thai restaurants is usually <em>Pad Thai</em>, which I find both comforting and flavorful.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for drinks, my absolute favorite is <strong>Indian Masala Chai</strong> â€” especially <em>Ginger Chai</em>. A day feels incomplete without a hot cup of this spiced tea. Itâ€™s more than just a drink to me â€” itâ€™s a daily ritual.
            </p>

            Music plays an important role in my life, especially Bollywood songs. Whenever Iâ€™m stressed or working on a task that doesnâ€™t require deep focus, I enjoy playing Bollywood music in the background. It helps me relax and lifts my mood.

          <p class="card-text">
            Since childhood, Iâ€™ve always wanted to learn a musical instrument. One day, I saw a man playing the saxophone in a movie â€” eyes closed, fully immersed â€” and it deeply inspired me. That moment stayed with me, and I eventually purchased an Alto saxophone and began teaching myself using music sheets.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            One of my proudest moments was playing the Indian National Anthem on the saxophone, which I even shared on Facebook. The experience of learning and playing this beautiful instrument has been deeply rewarding.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            Iâ€™m also a big fan of <strong>Indian wedding bands</strong> â€” the kind of lively brass bands that perform during the groom's procession or <em>Baraat</em>. To me, no Indian wedding feels complete without the energetic rhythm and celebratory vibe they bring. The dhol, trumpets, and dancing guests make it an unforgettable experience every time!

            Gardening is something I truly enjoy â€” especially when it involves aesthetically pleasing plants that bloom with colorful flowers or trees that bear delicious fruits. Thereâ€™s something deeply satisfying about watching nature thrive through your care.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            I also have a special love for lush green grass. I often imagine that in the future, when I have my own house, it will be surrounded by a variety of plants and trees â€” whether it's in the backyard, the front yard, or lining the driveway. A green, vibrant, and lively space is definitely part of my dream home.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            In addition to gardening, I also love feeding birds. Especially during summer, I put out rice and branded bird food that contains sunflower seeds, millet, and other grains. A variety of birds â€” sparrows, red-winged blackbird, northern cardinal, songbird â€” regularly visit my balcony to enjoy the food. Watching them brings me peace and joy, and I hope to continue this little tradition wherever I live.

            I always try to go to the gym for at least 30 to 45 minutes a day. It not only boosts my confidence but also makes me feel healthier and more energetic. Regular workouts help me maintain a strong and masculine physique â€” something I truly value.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, when I stop going to the gym, I start losing muscle and feel noticeably skinnier â€” which you might see in some of the older photos on this website. That physical change also affects how I feel mentally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thatâ€™s why I strongly believe that everyone should dedicate at least 30 minutes a day to their body. It's not just about fitness â€” itâ€™s about feeling good inside and out. Personally, I really enjoy working out, and it's become an important part of my daily routine.
