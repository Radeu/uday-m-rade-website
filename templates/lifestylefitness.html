    <h3 class="card-title mb-3">🥗 My Lifestyle & Fitness Philosophy 🏋️‍♂️</h3>
    <p class="card-text fs-5">
      I’m an early bird who enjoys starting the day around <strong>6 AM</strong> and winding down by <strong>11 PM</strong>. My daily routine reflects a deep commitment to healthy living, especially through mindful eating and physical activity.
    </p>
    <ul class="fs-5">
      <li><strong>🥣 Breakfast:</strong> My signature meal includes oats, milk, assorted nuts, and bananas — oil-free and nutrient-dense.</li>
      <li><strong>🥗 Lunch:</strong> A wholesome and filling meal (mostly Indian) with minimal oil.</li>
      <li><strong>🍇 Dinner:</strong> A light and refreshing plate of seasonal fruits, boiled eggs, and a small portion of carbohydrates, always cooked without oil.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="card-text fs-5">
      I usually cook my own meals and rarely order from outside, allowing me to maintain full control over the ingredients and nutritional quality of my food.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text fs-5">
      While I used to go to the gym daily, I’ve recently shifted toward more enjoyable activities like walking 🚶‍♂️ and bicycling 🚴‍♀️. That said, I may return to the gym soon as part of my evolving fitness journey.
